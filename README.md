# Myntra-Clone-Project :
This project is a rip-off of the popular online shopping site myntra.com. Clothing, accessories, shoes, beauty products, and many other items are available from the company, which deals exclusively in fast fashion.

## Tech Stack :
The following is the tech stack we used to build this website :-

<img src="https://cdn-icons-png.flaticon.com/512/732/732190.png" width=20 /> CSS

<img src="https://cdn-icons-png.flaticon.com/512/1199/1199124.png" width=20/> JavaScript

## Landing Page :
The menu bar, search button, Login, and Cart are all visible on the landing page of myntra.com. We tried our best to make our website look just like the original.

## Menu Section :
We've added a Menu section to the navbar; hovering over the menu will reveal the area's categories and subcategories.

## Product Page :
Users can filter their product choices based on their needs in the brand, price, and discount sections, and sorting is also available. We've added products from the original website and divided them into categories.

## Product Details Page:
On this page, the user can see all of the product's details, including images, name, seller, price, size, delivery options, and offers.
Users can check for product availability in their area by entering their Pincode, and then add the item to their cart.

## WishList or Favourite Section :
In the wishlist, users can add their favourite things or products.

## Cart Section :
When we use the Add to Bag button to add certain things, the products we choose will appear in the Cart Section.
Users can take advantage of the bank's offered offers in this section. We also have some coupons for additional savings.

## Payment Page :
Users can choose their preferred method of product payment here. This page's key feature is UPI Payment, which redirects customers to the final payment page when they select a method.

## Login and Create Account :
User can create or login into their account.
The registration process for new users will be completed here, and we have done our best to make it as simple as possible.

## Order or History Section :
The user can look up their order history and see all of the details.

## Responsive :
Our website is responsive as well.
